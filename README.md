# Description
This is a Full-stack application utilising the MERN tech stack that allows users to plan meals for future meals. The user can select a date on the calendar where they can search and save recipes to cook on the selected date. The user can see all meal plans saved for dates in the future, any recipes saved but the date has passed will be removed. 

# Live application
The application has been deployed on Heroku <http://mealmapper.herokuapp.com/>

# Technologies
  ## Tech Stack
   * MongoDB: a general purpose, document-based, distributed database I used to fetch, save and update the albums information.
Express: a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js I used to get, post and patch the albums information from / to the MongoDB database and the React single page app.
   * Node: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine I used to write JavaScript code on the server side.
   * React: a JavaScript library I used to build the user interface and gather data from the Express and external APIs.
   * CSS Flexbox: a flexible box layout module I used to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
